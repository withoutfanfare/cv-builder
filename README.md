## üìñ Usage Examples

### Creating Your First CV
Navigate to **CVs** ‚Üí **Create** and add sections (experience, projects, education, skills) via relation managers.

### Tracking a Job Application
Create an application under **Job Applications**, link your CV, add job details, and track status through the pipeline: `draft` ‚Üí `pending` ‚Üí `interviewing` ‚Üí `offer/rejected`.

### Tailoring with Section Profiles
Create custom profiles (e.g., "Frontend Focus") to reorder and filter CV sections non-destructively for different roles.

### Building Cover Letters
Use the template system with variables like `{{company_name}}` and `{{role_title}}` that auto-populate from your job application.

For detailed walkthroughs, see the [CV Management](.qoder/repowiki/en/content/CV%20Management/) and [Job Application Tracking](.qoder/repowiki/en/content/Job%20Application%20Tracking/) documentation.
